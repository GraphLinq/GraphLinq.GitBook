# Node & Fees

A node (blocks) is what graphs are made of, it describes the structure of your execution path. We prebuilt a set of nodes in the GraphLinq engine so that you can execute by passing through your needed parameters.

This means that you can launch on the Engine a set of blocks that automate a task without coding any of the business logic needed. To avoid having an overwhelm or a congested network we have to apply fees for execution (known as Gas on GraphLinq Chain) each block type has a different cost of execution within its Cycle optimized by the network and CPU consumed by itself.
