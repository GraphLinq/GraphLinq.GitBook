# Introduction

GraphLinq is a platform for automation and process optimization using Graphs. It provides a powerful and intuitive way for users to automate various tasks and workflows by creating and deploying graphs. The platform is built on a decentralized and EVM-compatible blockchain, with a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, allowing for a more secure and transparent platform for automation.

With GraphLinq, users can easily connect different services and data sources to automate tasks, streamline processes, and optimize workflow efficiency. Whether it's automating repetitive manual tasks, creating custom integrations, or streamlining complex workflows, GraphLinq makes it simple and accessible for users to create and deploy powerful automation solutions.

The platform's Mainnet launch marks a major milestone in the evolution of GraphLinq, bringing us closer to realizing our vision of a more decentralized and automated future.&#x20;

We believe that the Mainnet launch is just the beginning of a new and exciting chapter for GraphLinq. With the introduction of the Mainnet, we are laying the foundation for a more decentralized, efficient, and automated future.

The goal of GraphLinq is to provide a way to interact with the blockchain with any connected systems as effortlessly as possible and without knowing how to code.

Setting up bots, or basic scripted logic, arbitrages on DEX or trading on exchanges, deploying your own fungible and non fungible tokens, etc. we build the tools that help the decentralization adoption, every business have a logic that can be automated, we make it possible through monitoring and execution over multi-blockchains data.

In this documentation, you will find the basic knowledge of the GraphLinq Protocol and will get a better idea of how things work.
