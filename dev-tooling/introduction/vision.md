# Vision

GraphLinq is a set of tools, including an IDE and an engine, to automate various processes and tasks. With GraphLinq, users can create automation workflows using simple node-based graphs, without the need for coding skills. The platform supports multiple blockchains and centralized data streams, allowing for seamless integration with existing systems.

The GraphLinq platform is powered by the GLQ (GraphLinq Chain's native cryptoasset) which can be used to run graphs on the mainnet to automate tasks, and to pay gas fees on our chain. Users can easily listen to transactions on popular blockchain networks like Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, trigger events, and perform conditional regular expressions with just a few nodes.

Today, GraphLinq is making it possible for people and organizations to automate a wide range of workflows and processes with ease. With GraphLinq, users can save time and reduce costs by automating tasks that would otherwise require manual effort. The platform also provides a safe, secure, and accessible place for data to be stored and maintained, which is crucial for keeping services running smoothly.

At its core, GraphLinq's vision is to create a more efficient, cost-effective, and automated future by empowering people to automate their workflows and processes with ease. With its cutting-edge technology and community-driven approach, GraphLinq is positioning itself at the forefront of the decentralized automation revolution.
