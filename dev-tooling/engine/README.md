# Engine

The engine is the main core of GraphLinq Protocol, it's the software process that execute graphs over the network, We deployed two different protocol layer for testing, and using in production your own graph.

On the test-net you can deploy graph and test them for free but they have limited access and cycle length restrictions while it is unlimited on the main-net and only need a balance cover-up in the engine depositor smart-contract.

From a coding perspective, the engine is developed and maintained into .net core 3.1 (known as C# language) which allow for a fast execution and a cross-compatibility over any exploitation system.
