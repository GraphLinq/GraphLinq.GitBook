# HTTP

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) blocks in the GraphLinq IDE provide essential functionalities for making HTTP requests to interact with external web services and APIs. These blocks enable developers to retrieve data from external sources, send data to remote servers, and perform various operations that involve web-based communication.

The HTTP blocks facilitate seamless integration of graphs with web-based services, making them powerful tools for building applications that rely on external data sources or APIs.

The [Delete HTTP Request](delete-http-request.md) block is used to send HTTP DELETE requests to a specified URL. DELETE requests are commonly used to delete resources or data on a server. The block allows developers to configure headers, query parameters, and other options required for the DELETE request.

The [Get HTTP Request](get-http-request.md) block enables the execution of HTTP GET requests to retrieve data from a specified URL. GET requests are used to fetch data from servers without altering the server's state. The block allows developers to include headers, query parameters, and other options in the GET request.

The [Post HTTP Request](post-http-request.md) block facilitates the sending of HTTP POST requests to a designated URL. POST requests are typically used to submit data to the server to create new resources or perform other actions that change the server's state. The block supports customization of headers, query parameters, and the body of the POST request.

The [Put HTTP Request](put-http-request.md) block enables the execution of HTTP PUT requests to update resources on a server. PUT requests are commonly used to update existing data or resources. The block allows developers to specify headers, query parameters, and the body of the PUT request.

The [Array to JSON Body](array-to-json-body.md) block is a utility block that converts an array of data into a JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data interchange format, and this block is handy when preparing data to be sent as the body of an HTTP request.

The [Array To Body Values](array-to-body-values.md) block is another utility block used to convert an array of data into a format suitable for use in the body of an HTTP request. It allows developers to transform array data into a format that can be included as part of the request's body.

HTTP blocks play a crucial role in enabling graphs to interact with external web services, APIs, and data sources. These blocks empower developers to create dynamic and data-rich applications that leverage data from the web to enhance functionality and user experience. By utilizing HTTP blocks, developers can seamlessly integrate their graphs with web-based services, making them more versatile and capable of handling a wide range of tasks that involve web communication and data exchange.
