# On Graph Start

The On Graph Start block is an event-driven block that executes a specific sequence of actions or operations when the graph is started. Unlike the Entry Point block, which is a static starting point for all graphs, the On Graph Start block enables us to customize the behavior of the graph when it begins execution.

In the example below, the On Graph Start block is used to trigger a specific action when the graph is started:

When the graph is run, the On Graph Start block executes the specified action or operations defined within it. This block is particularly useful when we want to perform certain tasks or initializations when the graph starts running.
