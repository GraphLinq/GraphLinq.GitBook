# Entry Point

The Entry Point block is the starting point of every graph in the GraphLinq IDE. When a graph is executed, the flow of execution begins at the Entry Point block. This block serves as the entryway into the graph's logic and acts as the initial trigger for the entire workflow.

In the example below, the Entry Point block is connected to other blocks, creating a sequence of operations that will be executed when the graph starts:

When the graph is run, the execution starts at the Entry Point block, and the logic flows through the connected blocks in the order they are linked. The Entry Point block allows us to define the sequence of actions and operations to be performed when the graph is executed.
