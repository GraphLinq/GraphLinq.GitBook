# String

This block category contains blocks used to manipulate string data (sequences of letters, digits, and special characters).

This category contains [`Concat String`](concat-string.md) blocks, which take two strings as input and then merge them together into a single string, which is then output.

It also contains [`String Contains`](string-contains.md) blocks, which take two strings as input, and check whether the first string contains the second string as a substring (the way that the string "inigo montoya" contains the string "go monto").

Finally, this category includes [`Replace String In String`](replace-string-in-string.md) blocks, which allow you to search through a string and replace every instance of some substring with some other third string. These are especially useful for substituting calculated values into textual messages.\
