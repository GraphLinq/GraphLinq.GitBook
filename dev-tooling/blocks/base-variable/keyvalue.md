# KeyValue

A `KeyValue` pair is a data structure to associate a key with a value. This pair then represents two related data elements. The first is a constant used to define the data set. The other is a value, which is a variable belonging to the data set. For example, a car might be a key, while the car's color, model or brand could be the values.
