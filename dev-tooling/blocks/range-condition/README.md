# Range Condition

This block category is for blocks that control executive flow (which yellow connection will fire next) based upon whether a given value is above the upper bound of a range, or below the lower bound of a range.

This category presently only contains one type of block: [`Decimal Range Branch`](decimal-range-branch.md) blocks.
