# Last Node to JSON

The "Last Node to JSON" block in the GraphLinq IDE is used to convert the output of the last executed node in the graph to a JSON format. This block is especially useful when developers need to extract the final result of their graph's execution and represent it in a structured JSON format for further processing or data transmission.

Upon execution, the "Last Node to JSON" block takes the data output from the last executed node (which could be of any data type, such as a number, string, boolean, or even another JSON object) and converts it into a JSON representation. This JSON object will have a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the last executed node, and the value is the output data generated by that node.
