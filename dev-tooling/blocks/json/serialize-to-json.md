# Serialize to JSON

The "Serialize to JSON" block is similar to the "Serialize JSON Object" block, but with a key difference. This block is used to serialize any non-JSON data (such as numbers, strings, or arrays) into a JSON string representation.

Developers can use the "Serialize to JSON" block to convert other data types in the graph into a JSON string format for various applications, such as API calls or data storage.
