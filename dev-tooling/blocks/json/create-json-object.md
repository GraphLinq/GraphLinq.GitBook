# Create JSON Object

The "Create JSON Object" block allows developers to create a new JSON object from scratch. This block is used when a completely new JSON object needs to be generated during the execution of the graph.

Developers can use the "Create JSON Object" block to add multiple key-value pairs, similar to the "Convert To JSON" block. However, instead of adding properties to an existing object, this block creates a new JSON object that contains the specified key-value pairs.
