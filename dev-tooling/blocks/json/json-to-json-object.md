# JSON to JSON Object

The "JSON to JSON Object" block serves the purpose of converting a JSON string into an actual JSON object within the graph. Similar to the "JSON Deserialize To Array" block, this block is useful when working with JSON data obtained as strings.

Once executed, the "JSON to JSON Object" block takes the JSON string as input and parses it, transforming it into a JSON object that can be accessed and manipulated within the graph.
