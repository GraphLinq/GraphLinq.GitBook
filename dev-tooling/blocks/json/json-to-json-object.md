# JSON to JSON Object

The JSON To JSON Object block in the GraphLinq IDE is a versatile tool designed to convert JSON strings or objects into structured JSON objects. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data interchange format that represents data in a human-readable and lightweight manner. The JSON To JSON Object block enables developers to parse JSON data and extract specific elements or properties, allowing for further manipulation and analysis within the graph.

### Input Parameters

The JSON To JSON Object block has one input, which is the JSON data that needs to be converted into a JSON object format. This input can be a JSON string or a JSON object.

### Output

The JSON To JSON Object block outputs the data in a structured JSON object format, making it easy to access and work with specific elements and properties.

### Usage

The JSON To JSON Object block is particularly useful when developers need to extract specific information from JSON data and use it within the graph for various data processing tasks. It enables the isolation of individual elements from complex JSON data structures, allowing for more focused analysis and manipulation.

### Example

Suppose a graph receives data from an external API in JSON format, and the task is to extract certain properties from the JSON response and utilize them for specific operations. The JSON To JSON Object block can be employed to convert the JSON data into a structured JSON object and access the required elements:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

In this example, the JSON data represents a JSON object that contains properties such as "name," "age," and "email." The JSON To JSON Object block can convert this JSON object into a structured format, allowing for easy access and manipulation of its elements.

_Note:_ It is essential to ensure that the JSON data provided as input to the JSON To JSON Object block is well-formed and valid. Invalid JSON data may result in errors during parsing and conversion.

The JSON To JSON Object block empowers developers to extract specific elements from JSON data and represent them in a structured JSON object format within the graph. This facilitates more targeted data analysis, manipulation, and integration with other blocks for building sophisticated applications and automations.
