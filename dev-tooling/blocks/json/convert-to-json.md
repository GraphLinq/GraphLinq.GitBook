# Convert To JSON

The "Convert To JSON" block allows developers to create a custom JSON object by manually specifying key-value pairs. With this block, developers can tailor the JSON object to their specific requirements and populate it with relevant data.

When using the "Convert To JSON" block, developers can add multiple key-value pairs, where the keys are specified as strings, and the corresponding values can be any data type, including strings, numbers, or arrays. This flexibility enables developers to construct complex JSON objects that suit the needs of their applications.
