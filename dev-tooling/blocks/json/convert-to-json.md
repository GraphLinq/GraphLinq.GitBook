# Convert To JSON

The Convert To JSON block in the GraphLinq IDE is a versatile tool that enables developers to convert various data types into JSON format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data interchange format that is human-readable and easy for machines to parse. This block is valuable when developers need to prepare data for external APIs, databases, or other systems that require JSON-formatted data.

The Convert To JSON block accepts different types of data as input, such as strings, numbers, arrays, or objects. This means developers can pass various data structures to the block for conversion to JSON format.

The block's output is a JSON representation of the input data. The output is a JSON object that can include nested properties and values, depending on the structure of the input data.

### Use Case

Imagine a scenario where a graph receives data from multiple sources, such as a user inputting values, data fetched from an API, and calculations performed by the graph. Before sending this data to an external service or saving it in a database, the Convert To JSON block can be used to format the data into a unified JSON structure, ensuring consistent data representation across different sources.

### Example

Let's consider a simple example where a graph receives two numeric inputs, "temperature" and "humidity," from different blocks. These inputs might represent real-time weather data. The Convert To JSON block can then take these inputs and convert them into a JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
  "temperature": 25,
  "humidity": 60
}
```

In this example, the Convert To JSON block converts the individual temperature and humidity values into a single JSON object.

_Note:_ It is essential to ensure that the input data provided to the Convert To JSON block is compatible with JSON formatting. Data types that are not natively supported by JSON, such as circular structures or functions, may cause errors during the conversion process.

The Convert To JSON block significantly simplifies the process of converting diverse data types into a standardized JSON format. It empowers developers to seamlessly prepare data for consumption by external systems and services, enabling efficient data exchange and interoperability within the graph and beyond.
