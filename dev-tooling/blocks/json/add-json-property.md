# Add JSON Property

The "Add JSON Property" block enables developers to add new properties to an existing JSON object. This is particularly useful when there is a need to modify or extend the data stored in a JSON object during the execution of the graph.

With the "Add JSON Property" block, developers can specify the key (property name) and the value to be added to the JSON object. This block appends the new property to the existing JSON object, preserving any data already present in the object.
