# Merge JSON

The "Merge JSON" block provides a way to merge two or more JSON objects into a single JSON object. This block is useful when there is a need to combine multiple sets of data represented as JSON objects.

By specifying the JSON objects to be merged as inputs to the block, developers can create a new JSON object that contains the combined data from all the input objects. This allows for consolidation and organization of JSON data in a unified format.
