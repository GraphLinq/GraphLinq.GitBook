# JSON Deserialize To Array

The "JSON Deserialize To Array" block is designed to convert a JSON array (represented as a string) into an actual array data structure within the graph. This is particularly helpful when dealing with JSON data obtained from external sources, such as APIs, that may be in string format.

Upon execution, the "JSON Deserialize To Array" block takes the JSON array as input, parses it, and converts it into a usable array in the graph. This enables developers to access and manipulate the individual elements of the JSON array within the graph's logic.
