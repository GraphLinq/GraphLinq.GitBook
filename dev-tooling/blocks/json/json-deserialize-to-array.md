# JSON Deserialize To Array

The JSON Deserialize To Array block in the GraphLinq IDE is a powerful tool for extracting data from JSON representations and converting it into an array format. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data interchange format that represents data in a human-readable and lightweight manner. The JSON Deserialize To Array block allows developers to parse JSON strings or objects and transform them into structured arrays for further processing and analysis within the graph.

### Input Parameters

The JSON Deserialize To Array block has one input, which is the JSON data that needs to be converted into an array format. This input can be a JSON string or a JSON object.

### Output

The JSON Deserialize To Array block outputs the data in an array format that can be utilized by other blocks in the graph for various data manipulation tasks.

### Usage

The JSON Deserialize To Array block is essential when developers need to extract structured data from JSON representations and work with it in an array format. This is especially useful when dealing with APIs that return data in JSON format, as the block allows for easy transformation of the received JSON data into arrays that can be processed, filtered, and combined with other data within the graph.

### Example

Suppose a graph needs to fetch data from an external API that returns data in JSON format and then extract specific information from the JSON response. The JSON Deserialize To Array block can be used to convert the JSON data into an array, enabling further analysis and processing:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "john@example.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Jane",
    "age": 28,
    "email": "jane@example.com"
  }
]
```

In this example, the JSON data represents an array of user objects, where each object contains properties such as "name," "age," and "email." The JSON Deserialize To Array block can convert this JSON array into an array format that can be accessed and manipulated within the graph.

_Note:_ It is essential to ensure that the JSON data provided as input to the JSON Deserialize To Array block is well-formed and valid. Invalid JSON data may result in errors during parsing and conversion.

The JSON Deserialize To Array block empowers developers to work with JSON data in a structured and organized manner by converting it into arrays. This enables seamless integration of JSON data into graphs and facilitates data processing, analysis, and transformation tasks with ease.
