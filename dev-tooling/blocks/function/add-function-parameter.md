# Add Function Parameter

#### Add Function Parameter

Define and add parameters to a function within your graph The "Add Function Parameter" node is a pivotal asset in the GraphLinq framework, empowering developers to outline parameters dynamically in the function they are creating. This facilitates the process of developing multifaceted functionalities by allowing a detailed parameter setup to ensure smooth and detailed function executions.

**Block Description**

The "Add Function Parameter" node belongs to the Function category within the GraphLinq IDE. This node serves a critical role in setting up function blocks by enabling developers to add parameters to a function dynamically, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of the functions in different scenarios.

**Input Parameters**

The "Add Function Parameter" node needs to be connected to a series of inputs representing the parameters to be added to a function. The exact parameters would depend on the specific requirements of the function being created.

**Properties**

The node doesn't have specific properties as it functions to add parameters dynamically to the function it is associated with, using the inputs provided to it during the graph execution.

**Output**

The node doesnâ€™t have an output parameter. Its primary role is to add parameters to a function, setting the stage for the function's successful execution by other nodes in the graph.

**Methods**

The node will have methods to add parameters to the function dynamically. It will interact with the Function node to populate the function's parameter list, setting up the necessary environment for the function execution.

**Example Use Case**

Let's imagine a scenario where we are creating a function to handle user authentication:

1. Initially, an "Add Function Parameter" node is placed in the graph and is connected to a Function node representing a user authentication function.
2. Inputs representing parameters like "username" and "password" are connected to the "Add Function Parameter" node, defining them as necessary parameters for the authentication function.
3. Inside the function, nodes are set up to process the "username" and "password" parameters to authenticate the user.
4. In another section of the graph, a "Call Function" node calls the authentication function, passing the necessary "username" and "password" parameters for execution.
5. The function utilizes the parameters defined by the "Add Function Parameter" node to authenticate the user, returning a result indicating the success or failure of the authentication process.

By utilizing the "Add Function Parameter" node, developers can define a flexible function setup, adding as many parameters as necessary to ensure detailed and successful function executions, thereby creating robust and flexible graph solutions.
