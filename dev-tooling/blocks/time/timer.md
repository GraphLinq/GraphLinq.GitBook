# Timer

The Timer block is a powerful time-based control tool that enables developers to trigger events or actions at specified intervals. With this block, users can set a countdown timer, specifying the desired time delay before the event or action is executed.

The Timer block finds numerous applications in creating time-bound operations, scheduling periodic tasks, and orchestrating time-dependent actions. From sending recurring notifications to automating time-based processes, the Timer block enhances the graph's ability to handle dynamic and time-sensitive scenarios.
