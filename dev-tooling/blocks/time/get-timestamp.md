# Get Timestamp

The Get Timestamp block is a powerful tool within the GraphLinq IDE that allows users to obtain the current Unix timestamp with precision. A Unix timestamp represents the number of seconds that have elapsed since the "Unix epoch," which serves as a reference point set to January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). By utilizing the Get Timestamp block, developers can capture the current date and time precisely, providing a reliable foundation for time-based operations and calculations.

This block is especially useful in scenarios where real-time data is crucial, such as timestamping events, logging data, or synchronizing actions across multiple systems. The timestamp generated by the Get Timestamp block can be further manipulated, formatted, or compared with other time-related data in the graph, unlocking numerous possibilities for creating sophisticated workflows and applications.
