# Timestamp to Date

The Timestamp to Date block serves a similar purpose to the Format Date block but focuses on converting Unix timestamps to human-readable date formats. By simply inputting a Unix timestamp into this block, developers can obtain a formatted date string that represents the corresponding date and time.

This block is particularly useful in scenarios where developers need to work with time data in human-readable form for display purposes or further processing. Whether it's displaying timestamps in user interfaces, generating time-based reports, or organizing time-related data in a readable format, the Timestamp to Date block simplifies the conversion process.
