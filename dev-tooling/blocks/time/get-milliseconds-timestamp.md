# Get Milliseconds Timestamp

The Get Millisecond Timestamp block is a variant of the Get Timestamp block that offers even greater precision by including milliseconds in the generated timestamp. While the standard Unix timestamp provides time accuracy down to the second, the Get Millisecond Timestamp block allows developers to work with timestamps that include milliseconds, enhancing precision in time-based operations.

In certain applications, where time intervals need to be measured with extreme accuracy, the Get Millisecond Timestamp block becomes indispensable. It provides a level of granularity that can be essential for tasks such as high-frequency trading, real-time analytics, or any use case that demands precise timing.

By integrating the Get Millisecond Timestamp block into their graphs, developers gain access to sub-second time measurements, enabling them to build advanced applications that rely on precise timing and synchronization.
