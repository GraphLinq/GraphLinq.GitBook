# Execution Time Interval



The Execution Time Interval block serves as a valuable time-tracking tool within the GraphLinq IDE, enabling developers to measure the time interval between the start and end of executing a particular part of the graph. By incorporating this block into their graphs, developers can monitor the execution time of specific code segments, operations, or functions.

The Execution Time Interval block proves instrumental in performance analysis, allowing developers to identify potential bottlenecks or optimize critical sections of the graph. It provides insights into the time efficiency of different parts of the workflow and aids in debugging and optimizing graph execution.
