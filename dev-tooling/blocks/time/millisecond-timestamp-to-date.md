# Millisecond Timestamp to Date

The Millisecond Timestamp to Date block is an extended version of the Timestamp to Date block, allowing developers to convert Unix timestamps that include milliseconds into human-readable date formats. With this block, developers can work with timestamp data that offers sub-second precision.

Applications that require highly accurate time representation, such as real-time data visualization, time-sensitive analytics, or transactional systems, can benefit significantly from the Millisecond Timestamp to Date block. By leveraging this block's capabilities, developers can ensure that timestamp data is presented with the level of precision required by their specific use case.
