# Get Milliseconds Timestamp Offset

The Get Millisecond Timestamp Offset block is a high-precision variant of the Get Timestamp Offset block, allowing developers to perform timestamp manipulations with millisecond-level precision. Similar to its non-millisecond counterpart, this block enables the addition or subtraction of time intervals from Unix timestamps, but with greater granularity.

In applications that demand ultra-precise timing, such as high-frequency trading algorithms, real-time simulations, or scientific experiments, the Get Millisecond Timestamp Offset block proves invaluable. By leveraging this block's capabilities, developers can precisely schedule events, measure time intervals with extreme accuracy, and ensure seamless synchronization of actions.
