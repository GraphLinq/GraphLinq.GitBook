# Get Timestamp Offset

The Get Timestamp Offset block is a valuable addition to the GraphLinq IDE, empowering developers to manipulate timestamps by adding or subtracting time intervals. With this block, users can specify a time duration, such as hours, minutes, seconds, or even milliseconds, and apply it to the current Unix timestamp.

This block finds applications in scenarios where actions need to be triggered after a specific time delay or when developers need to determine timestamps for events in the future or the past. By incorporating the Get Timestamp Offset block into their graphs, developers can streamline time-based decision-making processes and create dynamic workflows that adapt to changing time conditions.
