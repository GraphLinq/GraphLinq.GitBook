# WebSocket

The WebSocket category in the GraphLinq IDE is dedicated to blocks that facilitate communication over WebSocket connections. WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables real-time, full-duplex communication between a client and a server. It provides a persistent connection, allowing data to be transmitted back and forth without the need to establish a new connection for each exchange. WebSocket is commonly used in web applications, chat applications, real-time gaming, and various other scenarios that require low-latency, bi-directional communication.

WebSocket blocks in the GraphLinq IDE allow developers to interact with WebSocket connections, enabling them to send and receive data, manage WebSocket connections, and handle events related to WebSocket connections.

The WebSocket blocks available in this category are as follows:

WebSocket Client Close: This block allows developers to close a WebSocket connection gracefully. Closing a WebSocket connection is an important part of managing WebSocket communications and ensuring that resources are released properly.

The WebSocket Client Connector block is used to establish a WebSocket connection with a specified WebSocket server. This block enables developers to initiate WebSocket communications and set up a bidirectional channel for data exchange.

The On WebSocket Client Disconnect block is an event handler that is triggered when a WebSocket client connection is closed. Developers can use this block to handle any cleanup tasks or perform specific actions when a WebSocket client disconnects.

WebSocket Receive Data Event: This block is an event handler that is triggered when data is received from a WebSocket connection. Developers can use this block to process incoming data and take appropriate actions based on the received data.

The WebSocket Send Data block is used to send data to a WebSocket server. This block enables developers to transmit information, messages, or commands to the WebSocket server, allowing for real-time updates and bidirectional communication.

WebSocket is a versatile and powerful protocol that opens up a wide range of possibilities for real-time communication and data exchange in web applications and beyond. The WebSocket blocks in the GraphLinq IDE provide developers with the tools to harness the capabilities of WebSocket and create dynamic, interactive, and responsive applications that leverage real-time communication for enhanced user experiences. By utilizing these blocks, developers can build applications that react instantaneously to user input, update data in real-time, and facilitate seamless and efficient bidirectional communication between clients and servers.
