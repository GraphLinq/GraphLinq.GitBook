# WebSocket

WebSocket blocks in the GraphLinq IDE facilitate the integration and communication with WebSocket-based services. WebSocket is a protocol that enables real-time, two-way communication between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. These blocks enable graphs to send and receive data via WebSocket connections, making them instrumental in building interactive and dynamic applications that require real-time data exchange.

These WebSocket blocks collectively empower graphs to interact with external WebSocket services, facilitating real-time data exchange and enabling the development of responsive and dynamic applications. With the ability to establish connections, send and receive data, and manage WebSocket clients, developers can harness the power of real-time communication for a wide range of use cases, including real-time dashboards, chat applications, live data updates, and more. The WebSocket blocks offer a seamless integration pathway for building modern and interactive applications within the GraphLinq IDE.
