# Math

The Math blocks in the GraphLinq IDE enable users to perform a wide range of mathematical operations and calculations within their graphs. These blocks empower developers to manipulate numeric data, perform complex calculations, and make data-driven decisions, making them essential tools for creating dynamic and efficient graph designs.

The [Subtract A - B](subtract-a-b.md) block allows users to perform subtraction operations between two numeric values, A and B, resulting in the output of A minus B. This block serves as a fundamental component for conducting basic subtraction calculations within graphs and acts as a building block for various mathematical scenarios.

The [Add A + B](add-a-+-b.md) block enables users to perform addition operations between two numeric values, A and B, yielding the result of A plus B. This block is crucial for conducting basic addition calculations and serves as a foundation for various aggregations and dynamic data processing in graphs.

The [Ceiling](ceiling.md) block is used to round a numeric value to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input value. This block is particularly useful for scenarios where data needs to be rounded up to the nearest whole number.

The [Divide A / B](divide-a-b.md) block allows users to perform division operations between two numeric values, A and B, resulting in the output of A divided by B. This block is essential for conducting basic division calculations within graphs and handling scenarios involving ratios and proportions.

The [Floor](floor.md) block is used to round a numeric value to the largest integer less than or equal to the input value. This block is valuable for scenarios where data needs to be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

The [Modulo A % B](modulo-a-b.md) block calculates the remainder when numeric value A is divided by B. This block is particularly useful for determining cyclic patterns and managing periodic calculations in graphs.

The [Multiply A \* B](multiply-a-b.md) block allows users to perform multiplication operations between two numeric values, A and B, resulting in the output of A multiplied by B. This block is essential for conducting basic multiplication calculations and is often used in data scaling and transformations.

The [Percentage Difference](percentage-difference.md) block computes the percentage difference between two numeric values, A and B. This block is valuable for analyzing data changes over time and comparing variations between data sets.

The [Round](round.md) block is used to round a numeric value to the nearest whole number or to a specific number of decimal places. This block is versatile and can be employed for various rounding operations based on the requirements of the graph.

The Math section in the GraphLinq IDE equips users with powerful tools for handling numerical data and conducting mathematical operations within their graphs. From simple arithmetic to more advanced calculations, the Math blocks open up a world of possibilities for building data-driven and precise graph designs. Each subsection provides unique functionalities that cater to different mathematical scenarios, enabling developers to create dynamic and efficient graph designs for a wide range of applications.







This block category comprises blocks used to perform basic arithmetic.

Included are block types for all the basic arithmetic operators: [`Add A + B`](add-a-+-b.md) blocks, [`Subtract A - B`](subtract-a-b.md) blocks, [`Multiply A * B`](multiply-a-b.md) blocks, [`Divide A / B`](divide-a-b.md) blocks, and [`Modulo A % B`](modulo-a-b.md) blocks.

This category also includes several block types related to rounding. [`Ceiling`](ceiling.md) blocks round up to the nearest integer, [`Floor`](floor.md) blocks round down to the nearest integer, and [`Round`](round.md) blocks round to some given precision (significant digits after the decimal).

Finally, this category includes [`Percentage Difference`](percentage-difference.md) blocks, which offer a quick way to calculate the percentage gain one number would need to undergo to become equal to another number.
