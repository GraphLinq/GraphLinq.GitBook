# Math

This block category comprises blocks used to perform basic arithmetic.

Included are block types for all the basic arithmetic operators: [`Add A + B`](add-a-+-b.md) blocks, [`Subtract A - B`](subtract-a-b.md) blocks, [`Multiply A * B`](multiply-a-b.md) blocks, [`Divide A / B`](divide-a-b.md) blocks, and [`Modulo A % B`](modulo-a-b.md) blocks.

This category also includes several block types related to rounding. [`Ceiling`](ceiling.md) blocks round up to the nearest integer, [`Floor`](floor.md) blocks round down to the nearest integer, and [`Round`](round.md) blocks round to some given precision (significant digits after the decimal).

Finally, this category includes [`Percentage Difference`](percentage-difference.md) blocks, which offer a quick way to calculate the percentage gain one number would need to undergo to become equal to another number.
