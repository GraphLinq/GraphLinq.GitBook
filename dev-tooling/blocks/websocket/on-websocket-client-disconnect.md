# On WebSocket Client Disconnect

The "One WebSocket Client Disconnect" block is used to disconnect a single WebSocket client from the server. This block is useful when there are multiple WebSocket clients connected, and the graph needs to disconnect a specific one. The block requires the WebSocket client identifier to target the desired client for disconnection.
