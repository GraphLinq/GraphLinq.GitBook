# WebSocket Send Data

The "WebSocket Send Data" block enables the graph to send data to the WebSocket server. This block is crucial for interactive applications that need to send real-time data updates or messages to the server. The block accepts data as an input, which is then transmitted through the WebSocket connection to the server.
