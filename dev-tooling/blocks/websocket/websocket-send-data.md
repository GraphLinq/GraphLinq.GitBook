# WebSocket Send Data

The WebSocket Send Data block in the GraphLinq IDE is a crucial component that allows developers to send data from the server to WebSocket clients. WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that facilitates real-time data exchange between clients and servers over a single, long-lived connection. The WebSocket Send Data block enables developers to push updates, messages, or other relevant data to WebSocket clients, allowing for real-time communication and dynamic content updates.

The WebSocket Send Data block plays a vital role in creating interactive and responsive applications that rely on real-time data updates sent to WebSocket clients. It allows developers to trigger events, send notifications, or update client interfaces with fresh data instantly.

The WebSocket Send Data block has the following essential input parameters:

1. WebSocket Client: The WebSocket Client input parameter is where developers connect the WebSocket client to which they want to send data. This input links the block to the WebSocket client connector block responsible for establishing the WebSocket connection.
2. Data: The Data input parameter is where developers define the data that they want to send to the WebSocket client. This can be in various formats, such as strings, JSON objects, binary data, etc., depending on the requirements of the WebSocket client.

The WebSocket Send Data block also provides the following crucial output parameter:

1. WebSocket Client: The WebSocket Client output parameter provides the WebSocket client reference, which can be used as an input for other blocks or actions that require the WebSocket client's reference or information.

The WebSocket Send Data block empowers developers to create dynamic and interactive applications that can push updates and information to WebSocket clients in real-time. By utilizing the Data input, developers can customize the content sent to the clients, enabling a wide range of real-time features and functionalities. Whether it's sending live chat messages, updating data visualizations, or notifying clients of important events, the WebSocket Send Data block is an essential tool for building responsive and engaging WebSocket-based applications.
