# WebSock Receive Data Event

The "WebSocket Receive Data Event" block acts as an event handler that listens for incoming data from the WebSocket server. When data is received through the established WebSocket connection, this block triggers the graph's execution flow, allowing the data to be processed and used within the graph.
