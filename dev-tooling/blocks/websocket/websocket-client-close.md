# WebSocket Client Close

The "WebSocket Client Close" block allows the graph to close an established WebSocket connection. When this block is executed, it triggers the WebSocket client to gracefully terminate the connection with the WebSocket server. This can be useful when the communication is no longer required or when the graph needs to switch to a different WebSocket connection.
