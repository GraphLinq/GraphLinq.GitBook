# Overview

The GraphLinq ecosystem comprises two main components: the GraphLinq Chain and the GraphLinq Protocol. The GraphLinq Protocol is an automated process management solution that is designed to make it easy for users to deploy and manage various types of automation without the need for coding skills. This protocol is made up of four key components: the IDE, the App, the Engine, and the Marketplace.

The **GraphLinq Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a powerful tool that allows users to create automation through a simple drag-and-drop interface. The IDE provides users with a visual representation of the automation process and makes it easy to connect different nodes together to create complex automation.

The **GraphLinq App** is a user-friendly interface that allows users to access pre-made automation templates and deploy them with just a few clicks. The app makes it easy for users to customize the templates by updating variables and deploying the automation directly from the app.

The **GraphLinq Engine** is the core component of the GraphLinq Protocol that executes automation and ensures that they are executed accurately and securely. The engine runs on the GraphLinq Chain and is responsible for executing the nodes in a user's automation and ensuring that all data is processed correctly.

The **GraphLinq Marketplace** is a platform that allows users to buy, sell, and trade. GLQ templates and other types of automation. The marketplace provides users with access to a wide range of automation templates and allows them to connect with other users to offer or request specific types of automation.

The **GraphLinq Chain** is a blockchain that is specifically designed to support the GraphLinq Protocol. The chain is a Proof-of-Authority (POA) blockchain that provides a secure and scalable platform for running automation. The GraphLinq Protocol utilizes the GraphLinq Chain to ensure that automation is executed securely and accurately.

In the future, GraphLinq plans to expand its ecosystem and create a platform for more decentralized applications (dApps) to run on its chain. This will provide users with access to a broader range of services and applications that can be integrated into their automation, allowing them to automate even more complex processes and tasks.
