# Clique Consensus

Clique is a consensus mechanism used by GraphLinq Chain. The mechanism is designed to increase the speed and security of transactions on the chain, while still maintaining a high degree of decentralization.

In Clique, there are a set of designated validators or "authorities" who are responsible for validating transactions and adding new blocks to the chain. These authorities are selected through a transparent and democratic process, and are periodically re-elected to ensure that the network is always run by a trusted group of participants.

The Clique consensus mechanism is different from other proof-of-work (POW) or proof-of-stake (POS) algorithms in that it does not rely on miners to validate transactions or add new blocks to the chain. Instead, the designated authorities take on this responsibility.

To add a new block to the chain, an authority must propose a block and broadcast it to the rest of the network. The other authorities then validate the proposed block and vote to either accept or reject it. If a sufficient number of authorities agree to accept the block, it is added to the chain and becomes part of the permanent ledger.

The Clique consensus mechanism is designed to provide fast and secure transactions, as the authorities are incentivized to act in the best interests of the network and its users. Additionally, because the authorities are selected through a democratic process, the mechanism provides a high degree of decentralization and ensures that the network is run by a trustworthy group of participants.
