# Wallet

GraphLinq Chain uses our own blockchain network, which is EVM compatible so you can connect via any EVM compatible wallet like MetaMask \[[Official MetaMask Website](https://metamask.io/)].

These wallets are applications that let you interact with your GraphLinq Chain account. Think of it like an internet banking app â€“ without the bank.

Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications. You need a wallet to send funds and manage your GLQ.
