# Wallet

GraphLinq Protocol use our own network, which is an EVM compatible blockchain so you can connect via any EVM compatible wallet like metamask.

These wallets are applications that let you interact with your GraphLinq Chain account. Think of it like an internet banking app â€“ without the bank.

Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications. You need a wallet to send funds and manage your GLQ.
