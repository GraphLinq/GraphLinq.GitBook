# RPC Public Nodes

The GraphLinq Chain has implemented a regional distribution of remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, providing optimized access for users in different geographic regions. The three different RPC nodes are: Asia, North America, and Europe. GraphLinq Chain will detect the best node for your location.

By having separate RPC nodes for different regions, the GraphLinq Chain aims to provide a faster and more reliable user experience for its community. Users are automatically connected to a node which is specifically optimized for their location, to interact with the GraphLinq Chain.

By providing optimized access for users in different regions, the GraphLinq Chain is working to ensure a fast and reliable experience for its community. Additionally, our nodes are hosted on different Network and Server providers making the GraphLinq chain even more reliable.
