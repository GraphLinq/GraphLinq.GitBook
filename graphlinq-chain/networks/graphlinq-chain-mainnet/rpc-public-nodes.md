# RPC Public Nodes

The GraphLinq Chain has implemented a regional distribution of remote procedure call (RPC) nodes, providing optimized access for users in different geographic regions. The three different RPC nodes are:

1. **Asia region**: [https://node1.graphlinq.io/](https://node1.graphlinq.io/)
2. **North America region**: [https://node2.graphlinq.io/](https://node2.graphlinq.io/)
3. **Europe region**: [https://node3.graphlinq.io/](https://node3.graphlinq.io/)

By having separate RPC nodes for different regions, the GraphLinq Chain aims to provide a faster and more reliable user experience for its community. Users are automatically connected to a node which is specifically optimized for their location, to interact with the GraphLinq Chain.

By providing optimized access for users in different regions, the GraphLinq Chain is working to ensure a fast and reliable experience for its community.
