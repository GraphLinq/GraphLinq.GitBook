6. After the transaction is successfully confirmed, switch your wallet to the GraphLinq Chain's network. If you don't have GraphLinq Chain on your MetaMask, here is [how you can add it simply](../networks/graphlinq-chain-mainnet/wallet/add-graphlinq-chain-to-metamask.md)

7. Click on "Claim GLQ from GraphLinq Network" and confirm the transaction on your wallet extension. If you had the same address on Ethereum chain, you've been airdropped enough Gas fees in GLQ to be able to claim your bridged tokens on the new network.&#x20;

Your bridge is completed successfully.

**Note:** The minimum required GLQ for paying gas fees for doing the first transaction on the mainnet for claiming GLQ has been airdropped to all GLQ holders on Ethereum's addresses on the new GraphLinq Chain. &#x20;
