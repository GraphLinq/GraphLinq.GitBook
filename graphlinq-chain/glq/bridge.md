7. After the transaction is successfully confirmed, switch your wallet to the GraphLinq Chain's network or Ethereum network. If you don't have GraphLinq Chain on your MetaMask, here is [how you can add it simply](../networks/graphlinq-chain-mainnet/wallet/add-graphlinq-chain-to-metamask.md)

8. Click on "Claim GLQ from GraphLinq Network" or "Claim GLQ from Ethereum Network" and confirm the transaction on your web3 wallet. If you had the same address on Ethereum chain, you've been airdropped enough Gas fees in GLQ to be able to claim your bridged tokens on the new network.&#x20;

Your bridge is completed successfully.&#x20;

**Note:** The minimum required GLQ for paying gas fees for doing the first transaction on the mainnet (for claiming bridged GLQ) has been airdropped to all (Erc20 GLQ)holders on the new GraphLinq Chain. &#x20;
