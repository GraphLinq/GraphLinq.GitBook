# GLQ

GLQ is the native asset of GraphLinq Chain, it's the token used for every financial transactions on the protocol and community need.

With the GLQ token, you can run your graphs executed over the GraphLinq engine network and pay the fees for executions.

Every token minted since the creation of the token used as GAS fees to pay graph will be burned reducing the supply of the token to assure a curve of evolution and help with the market adoption.

We will also use the token as DAO governance to offers to the community the possibility of choosing the future of GraphLinq and the next developments to focus on.
